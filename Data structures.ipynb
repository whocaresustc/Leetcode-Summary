    "- list – Mutable Dynamic Arrays\n",
    "Lists are a part of the core Python language. Despite their name, Python’s lists are implemented as dynamic arrays behind the scenes. This means lists allow elements to be added or removed and they will automatically adjust the backing store that holds these elements by allocating or releasing memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists can hold arbitrary elements—“everything” is an object in Python, including functions. Therefore you can mix and match different kinds of data types and store them all in a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a powerful feature, but the downside is that supporting multiple data types at the same time means that data is generally less tightly packed and the whole structure takes up more space as a result.\n",

    "## [Stack (LIFO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)):\n",
    "In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- push, which adds an element to the collection, and\n",
    "- pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data structure makes it possible to implement a stack as a singly linked list and a pointer to the top element. A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is then considered to be in an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [The list Built-in](https://www.edureka.co/blog/stack-in-python/):\n",
    "Python’s built-in list type makes a decent stack data structure as it supports push and pop operations in amortized O(1) time. (If you do an operation say a million times, you don't really care about the worst-case or the best-case of that operation - what you care about is how much time is taken in total when you repeat the operation a million times.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s lists are implemented as dynamic arrays internally which means they occasionally need to resize the storage space for elements stored in them whenever they are added or removed. The storage space is allocated more than required, so that not every push or pop requires resizing and you get an amortized O(1) time complexity for these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this makes their performance less consistent than the stable O(1) inserts and deletes provided by a linked list-based implementation. On the other hand, lists provide fast O(1) time random access to elements on the stack which can be an added benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The collections.deque Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "The deque class implements a double-ended queue which supports addition and removal of elements from either end in O(1) time (non-amortized).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because deques support adding and removing elements from both ends equally well, they can serve both as queues and as stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s deque objects are implemented as doubly-linked lists which gives them proper and consistent performance insertion and deletion of elements, but poor O(n) performance as they randomly access elements in the middle of the stack.\n",

However, lists are quite slow for this purpose because inserting or deleting an element at the beginning requires shifting all of the other elements by one, requiring O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementation using collections.deque\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue in Python can be implemented using deque class from the collections module. Deque is preferred over list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations from both the ends of container, as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which provides O(n) time complexity.
